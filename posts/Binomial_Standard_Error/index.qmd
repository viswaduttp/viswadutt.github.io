A coin is tossed 1000 times and it landed heads 400 times. How confident we are whether the coin is fair ?

We can do a test of proportions, and our test statistic is ($\bar{p}$-${P}$)/$\sqrt{PQ/n}$

The sample size (n) is 1000 and we have observed heads 400 times meaning 
$\bar{p}$ = 0.4 and $\bar{q}$  = 0.6. 

The sample mean $\bar{x}$ is 400 (1000 x 0.4) (X is binomial)

here P = Q = 0.5 (population estimate)

Now the denominator $\sqrt{PQ/n}$ is the standard error of the sample proportion $\bar{p}$

This variance scaling is not really intuitive at the first look.

The variance is scaled by square of n, so the variance of sample proportion is ${nPQ/n^2}$ which is PQ/n and hence the standard error (same as standard deviation) is $\sqrt{PQ/n}$

We could have solved the problem by testing number of heads instead of proportion of heads (400-500/15.81). 15.81 is just simply $\sqrt{0.5*.0.5*1000}$
