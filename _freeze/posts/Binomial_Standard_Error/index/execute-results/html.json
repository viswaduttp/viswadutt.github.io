How confident we are whether the coin is fair ?\n\nThis is a pretty standard hypothesis testing problem. \n\nThe sample size (n) is 1000 and we have observed heads 400 times meaning \n$\\bar{p}$ = 0.4 and $\\bar{q}$  = 0.6. \n\nThe sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is 400 and the sample standard deviation (s) is $\\sqrt{1000*0.4*0.6}$ ~ 15.49\n\nNow we do a test of proportions and our test statistic is ($\\bar{p}$-${P}$)/$\\sqrt{PQ/n}$\n\nhere P = Q = 0.5\n\nNow the denominator $\\sqrt{PQ/n}$ is the standard error of the sample proportion $\\bar{p}$\n\nThe variance is scaled by square of n, so the variance of sample proportion is ${nPQ/n^{2}$ which is PQ/n and hence the standard error is  $\\sqrt{PQ/n}$\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
